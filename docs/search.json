    "text": "1.1 What is a language\nIntuitively, a language is just a collection of correct sentences. In natural languages (Spanish, English, etc,), each sentence is made up of words, which have some intrinsic meaning, and there are rules that describe which sequences of words are valid.\nSome of these rules, which we often call “syntactic” are just about the structure of words and sentences, and not their meaning–like how nouns and adjectives must match in gender and number or how verbs connect to adverbs and other modifiers. Other rules, which we call “semantic”, deal with the valid meanings of collections of words–the reason why the sentence “the salad was happy” is perfectly valid syntactically but makes no sense. In linguistics, the set of rules that determine which sentences are valid is called a “grammar”.\nIn formal language theory, we want to make all these notions as precise as possible in mathematical terms. To achieve so, we will have to make some simplifications which, ultimately, will imply that natural languages fall outside the scope of what formal language theory can fully study. But these simplifications will enable us to define a very robust notion of language for which we can make pretty strong theoretical claims.\nSo let’s build this definition from the ground up, starting with our notion of words, or, formally, symbols:\nExamples of symbols in abstract languages might be single letters like a, b or c. In programming languages, a symbol might be a variable name, a number, or a keyword like for or class. The next step is to define sentences:\nAn example of a sentence formed with the symbols a and b is abba. In a programming language like C# or Python, a sentence can be anything from a single expression to a full program.\nOne special string is the empty string, which has zero symbols, and will often bite us in proofs. It is often denoted as \\(\\epsilon\\).\nWe are almost ready to define a language. But before, we need to define a “vocabulary”, which is just a collection of valid symbols.\nAn example of a vocabulary is \\(\\{ a,b,c \\}\\), which contains three symbols. In a programming language like Python, a sensible vocabulary would be something like \\(\\{ \\mathrm{for}, \\mathrm{while}, \\mathrm{def}, \\mathrm{class}, ... \\}\\) containing all keywords, but also symbols like +, ., etc.\nGiven a concrete vocabulary, we can then define a language as a (posibly infinite) subset of all the sentences that can be formed with the symbols from that vocabulary.\nLet’s see some examples.",

At the same time, I’m claiming that things like variable and function names, and all identifiers in general, will end up being part of the vocabulary in programming languages. However, there are infinitely many valid identifiers, so… how does that work?\nThe solution to this problem is that we will actually deal with two different languages, on two different levels. We will define a first language for the tokens, which just determines what types of identifiers, numbers, etc., are valid. Then the actual programming language will be defined based on the types of tokens available. So, all numbers are the same token, all identifiers are another token, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.4 (Language) Given a vocabulary \\(V\\), a language \\(L\\) is a set of sentences with symbols taken from \\(V\\).",

    "section": "1.2 Examples of languages",
    "text": "1.2 Examples of languages\nTo illustrate how rich languages can be, let’s define a simple vocabulary with just two symbols, \\(V = \\{a,b\\}\\), and see how many interesting languages we can come up with.\nThe simplest possible language in any vocabulary is the singleton language whose only sentence is formed by a single symbol from the vocabulary. For example, \\(L_a=\\{a\\}\\) or \\(L_b = \\{b\\}\\). This is, of course, rather useless, so let’s keep up.\nWe can also define what’s called a finite language, which is just a collection a few (or perhaps many) specific strings. For example, \\[L_1 = \\{bab, abba, ababa, babba\\}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSince languages are sets, there is no intrinsic order to the sentences in a language. For visualization purposes, we will often sort sentences in a language in shortest-to-largest, and then lexicographic order, assuming there is a natural order for the symbols. But this is just one arbitrary way of doing it.\n\n\nNow we can enter the realm of infinite languages. Even when the vocabulary is finite, and each sentence itself is also as finite sequence of symbols, we can have infinitely many different sentences in a language. If you need to convince yourself of this claim, think about the language of natural numbers: every natural number is a finite sequence of, at most, 10 different digits, and yet, we have infinitely many natural numbers because we always take a number and add a digit at the end to make a new one.\nIn the same sense, we can have infinite languages simply by concatenating symbols from the vocabulary ad infinitum. The most straightforward infinite language we can make from an arbitrary vocabulary \\(V\\) is called the universe language, and it’s just the collection of all possible strings one can form with symbols from \\(V\\).\n\nDefinition 1.5 (Universe language) Given a vocabulary \\(V\\), the universe language, denoted \\(V^*\\) is the set of all possible strings that can be formed with symbols from \\(V\\).\n\nAn extensional representation of a finite portion of \\(V^*\\) would be:\n\\[V^* = \\{\\epsilon,a,b,aa,ab,ba,bb,aaa,aab,aba,abb,baa,bab,bba,bbb,...\\}\\]\nWe can now easily see that an alternative definition of language could be any subset of the universe language of a given vocabulary \\(V\\).\nNow let’s take it up a notch. We can come up with a gazillion languages just involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), by concocting different relationships between the symbols. For this, we will need some way to describe the languages that doesn’t require listing all the elements–as they are infinitely many. We can do it with natural language, of course, but in the long run it will pay to be a slightly more formal when describing infinite languages.\nFor example, let \\(L_2\\) be the language of strings over the alphabet \\(V=\\{a,b\\}\\) that has the exact same number of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\\[L_2 = \\{\\epsilon, ab, aabb, abab, baba, baab, abba, ...\\}\\]\nWe can define it with a bit of math syntax sugar as follows:\n\\[L_2 = \\{ \\omega \\in \\{a,b\\}^* | \\#(a,\\omega) = \\#(b,\\omega) \\}\\]\nLet’s unpack this definition. We start by saying, \\(\\omega \\in \\{a,b\\}^*\\), which literaly parses as “strings \\(\\omega\\) in the universe language of the vocabulary \\(\\{a,b\\}\\)”, but is just standard jargon to say “string made out of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then we add the conditional part \\(\\#(a,\\omega) = \\#(b,\\omega)\\) which should be pretty straightforward: we are using the \\(\\#(\\mathrm{&lt;symbol&gt;},\\mathrm{&lt;string&gt;})\\) notation to denote the function that counts a given symbol in a string.\n\\(L_2\\) is slightly more interesting than \\(V^*\\) because it introduces the notion that a formal language is equivalent to some computation. This insight is the fundamental idea that links formal languages and computability theory, and we will formalize this idea in the next section. But first, let’s see other, even more interesting languages, to solidify this intuition that languages equal computation.\nLet’s define \\(L_3\\) as the language of all strings in \\(V^*\\) where the number \\(a\\) is a prime factor of the number of \\(b\\). Intuitively, working with this language–e.g., finding valid strings–will require us to solve prime factoring, as any question about \\(L\\) that has different answers for string in \\(L\\) than for strings not in \\(L\\) will necessarily go through what it means for a number to be a prime factor of another.\nBut it gets better. We can define the language of all strings made out of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that, when interpreting \\(a\\) as \\(0\\) and \\(b\\) as \\(1\\), the resulting binary number has any property we want. We can thus codify all problems in number theory as problems in formal language theory.\nAnd, as you can probably understand already, we can easily codify any mathematical problem, not just about number theory. Ultimately, we can define a language as the set of strings that are valid input/ouput pairs for any specific problem we can come up with. Let’s make this intuition formal.",

    "text": "1.3 Recognizing a language\nThe central problem is formal language theory is called the word problem. Intuitively, it is about determining whether a given string is part of a language, or not. Formally:\n\nDefinition 1.6 (The Word Problem) Given a language \\(L\\) on some vocabulary \\(V\\), the word problem is defined as devising a procedure that, for any string \\(\\omega \\in V^*\\), determines where \\(\\omega \\in L\\).\n\nNotice that we didn’t define the word problem simply as “given a language \\(L\\) and a string \\(\\omega\\), is $omega L$”. Why? Because we might be able to answer that question correctly only for some \\(\\omega\\), but not all. Instead, the word problem is coming up with an algorithm that answers for all possible strings \\(\\omega\\)–technically, a procedure, which is not exactly the same, we will see the details in ?sec-computability.\nThe word problem is the most important question in formal language theory, and one of the central problems in computer science in general. So much so, that we actually classify languages (and by extension, all computer science problems) according to how easy or hard it is to solve their related word problem.\nIn the next few chapters, we will review different classes of languages that have certain common characterists which make them, in a sense, equally complex. But first, let’s see what it would take to solve the word problem in our example languages.\nSolving the word problem in any finite language is trivial. You only need to iterate through all of the strings in the language. The word problem becomes way more interesting when we have infinite languages. In these cases, we need to define a recognizer mechanism, that is, some sort of computational algorithm or procedure to determine whether any particular string is part of the language.\nFor example, language \\(L_2\\) has a very simple solution to the word problem. The following Python program gets the job done:\ndef l2(s):\n    a,b = 0,0\n\n    for c in s:\n        if c == \"a\":\n            a += 1\n        else:\n            b += 1\n    return a == b\nA fundamental question in formal language theory is not only coming up with a solution to the word problem for a given language but, actually, coming up with the simplest solution–for a very specific definition of simple: how much do you need to remember. In other words: what kind of algorithms can solve the word problem for what kind of languages?\nFor example, we can solve \\(L_2\\) with \\(O(n)\\) memory. That is, we need to remember something that is proportional to how many \\(a\\)’s and \\(b\\)’s are in the string. And we cannot solve it with anything less than that, as we will prove a couple chapters down the road.\nNow, let’s turn to the opposite problem, that of generating strings from a given language, and wonder what, if any, is the connection between these two.",

    "text": "1.4 Generating a language\nSuppose you want to generate all strings from a language like \\(L_2\\). To make things simpler, let’s redefine it as \\(L_2'\\), the language of strings over \\(\\{a,b\\}\\) with the same number of \\(a\\)’s and \\(b\\)’ but where all \\(a\\)’s come before all \\(b\\)’s. This means \\(aabb\\) is a valid string in \\(L\\), but not \\(abba\\). This language is also called \\(a^n b^n\\), that is, \\(n\\) symbols \\(a\\) followed by \\(n\\) symbols \\(b\\).\nHere is a simple Python method that generates infinitely many strings from \\(L_2'\\):\ndef generate_l2():\n    s = \"\"\n\n    while True:\n        yield s\n        s = \"a\" + s + \"b\"\nLet’s unpack this. We start with the empty string \\(\\epsilon\\), defined in code as s = \"\". Then, we enter an infinite cycle where we yield the current string, and then attach an \\(a\\) to the front and a \\(b\\) to the back. Take a moment to convince yourself that any string in the form \\(a^n b^n\\) is eventually generated by this method and, furthermore, only those strings are generated by the method.\nThis method is actually pretty neat because it not only generates (eventually) all of \\(a^n b^n\\); it does so in increasing length order. It isn’t immediately obvious why this is such a good thing but here’s a bold claim: if you have a generating method for any language \\(L\\), then you have a recognizing method too.\nWait, what!? Yep, you heard it right. And actually, it goes both ways. If you have a recognizing algorithm, you also have a generating one. Let’s make this our first theorem in formal language theory.\n\nTheorem 1.1 Let \\(L\\) be a formal language. There exists an algorithm \\(A\\) for generating all strings in \\(L\\) (in increasing length order) if and only if there also exists another algorithm \\(A'\\) for solving its word problem.\n\n\nProof. To prove this, let’s first understand what the theorem is saying. If we have an algorithm \\(A\\) that generates all strings in a language, we can also come up with another algorithm \\(A'\\) (presumably using \\(A\\)) that solves the word problem, and viceversa.\nTo prove this type of theorems, the most usual approach is to assume you have \\(A\\) (or \\(A'\\)) as some kind of abstract, black-box algorithm, and try to construct the other. Let’s do it from generation to recognition first, as the other way around will be fairly easy once this is done.\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) Suppose we have an algorithm \\(A\\) that generates all strings in \\(L\\), and we are given an arbitrary string \\(\\omega\\). Let \\(n = |\\omega|\\) be the length of \\(\\omega\\). We just need to run \\(A\\) until we either see \\(\\omega\\), in which case the answer is true (\\(\\omega \\in L\\)) or until we see one string with length greater than \\(n\\), in which case the answer is false (\\(\\omega \\notin L\\)). Since \\(A\\) generates strings in increasing length order, one of these must happen in a finite time for any \\(\\omega\\).\nNow let’s do the other way around.\n\\(\\Leftarrow\\) Suppose we have an algorithm \\(A'\\) that solves the word problem from \\(L\\). Then we do the following. Define \\(L^*\\) as the universe language associated with \\(L\\). We can very easily code a generating algorithm \\(A^*\\) for \\(L^*\\) in increasing length order, simply by permuting all symbols1. Now, run \\(A^*\\) and, for each string \\(\\omega\\) generated, run \\(A'(\\omega)\\). If the output is true, then yield \\(\\omega\\). Otherwise, skip it.\n\nSo there you have it. Generating (in increasing order) and recognizing are two faces of the same problem. Cool, right? But why does this matter? For starters, it gives us a tremendously powerful connection between two sub-branches of formal language theory that we will explore in the following chapters.",

    "text": "5.1 A didactic language\nThe HULK language has been designed as a mechanism for learning and evaluating a college course about compilers. For this reason, certain language design decisions respond more to didactic questions than to theoretical or pragmatic questions. An illustrative example is the inclusion of a single basic numerical type. In practice, programming languages have several numeric types (int, float, double, decimal) to cover the wide range of trade-off between efficiency and expressivity. However, from the didactic point of view, it is enough complexity to have to deal with a numerical type, and the inclusion of others does not bring anything new from our point of view.\nAnother important decision is the static typing with type inference, which will be explained later in detail. The motivation behind this feature is to allow students to first implement an evaluator for the language, and then worry about type verification. Likewise, the decision to have global expressions, global functions, and classes, responds to the need to introduce the various elements of language little by little. By having global expressions, it is possible to implement an expression interpreter without the need to solve context-sensitive problems. Later, students can implement functions and finally the object-oriented features. In this way students can learn on the fly as they add characteristics to the language, always having a valid subset of the language implemented.",

Actually, the HULK language really is not really a single programming language, but a set of programming languages. That is, HULK is designed as a set of layers, each with a new language feature that add increasingly more complex functionalities on top of the previous layers. It starts with a basic syntax for expressions, then global functions, and then a unified type system with simple inheritance. Afterwards, HULK grows to contain arrays, delegates, type inference, iterators, among other characteristics. All these language features have been designed to be compatible with each other. Furthermore, each language feature clearly describes on which other language features it depends.\nThis design has been conceived to allow the use of HULK at a wide range of learning levels. As a language of expressions and functions, it is useful for introductory courses on parsing and basic compilation techniques. Object orientation introduces a whole universe of semantic complexities; however, the HULK type system is simple enough to illustrate the most common problems in semantic type verification. Vectors introduce problems related to memory management, while anonymous functions and iterators are fundamentally problems of transpilation and code generation. The inference of types and the verification of null-safety is an exercise in logical inference, which can be used in advanced courses. The idea is that each course defines its objectives of interest, and can use an appropriate subset of HULK to illustrate and evaluate them.",

The formal definition is given in the section about type semantics.\n\nEvery type conforms to Object.\nEvery type conforms to itself.\nIf T1 inherits T2 then T1 conforms to T2.\nIf T1 conforms to T2 and T2 conforms to T3 then T1 conforms to T3.\nThe only types that conform to Number, String, and Boolean, are respectively those same types.\n\nTypes in HULK form a single hierarchy rooted at Object. In this hierarchy the conforming relationship is equivalent to the descendant relationship. Thus, if T1 conforms to T2 that means that T1 is a descendant of T2 (or trivially the same type). Thus, we can talk of the lowest common ancestor of a set of types T1, T2, …, Tn, which is the most specific type T such that all Ti conform to T.

Afterwards, the type checker verifies that all semantic rules are valid.\nThus, even if a program is fully annotated, the type inferer still needs to work, since it needs to infer the type of all expressions. When some symbols are not explicitly annotated, the type inferer must also assign types for them.\nHence, there are two different moments when a semantic error can be reported. First, if the type inferer cannot infer the type of some symbol, a semantic error will be thrown to indicate the programmer that some symbol must be explicitly typed. Second, if the type inferer finished without errors, the type checker will verify that all types are consistent, and will report a semantic error if there is some incompatibilty.",

This process is performed bottom-up, starting from atomic sub-expressions (e.g., literals) and working up the AST. The exact rules for type inference of expressions is given in the section a`bout type semantics, but an intuitive introduction can be given at this point.\nLiterals are the easiest to type-infer, because their type comes directly from the parser. Arithmetic expressions are also easy, because their type is always Number. Likewise, string and boolean operators are straightforward.\nThe type of complex expressions that have an expression body is determined by the type of the body. This is the case of let, while, and for. The type of an expression block is the type of the last expresion of the block. The type of a function or method invocation is the type of its body. The type of expressions that have more than one branch (if) is the lowest common ancestor of the types of each branch, or ultimately Object.",

    "text": "13.3 Type inference of symbols\nOnce all expressions have been type-inferred, the type inferer will attempt to assing a type to each symbol declaration that is not explicitly annotated. Instead of providing an exact algorithm, we will define a set of constraints that the type inferer must satisfy whenever it succeeds in assigning a type.\nSpecific implementations of HULK can choose different methods to attempt the type inference of symbols. According to the order in which symbols are processed, and the sophistication of each method, some implementations may succed where others fail. However, if two type inference algorithms are correct, they most agree on all types for which both succeed in the inference.\nThese are the constraints a type inference algorithm must satisfy to be correct, or otherwise it must report a failed inference.\n\nIn a let expression, whenever a variable is not type-annotated, the type inferer must asign a type for the variable that is equivalent to the type infered for its initialization expression.\nSimilarly, in an attribute declaration that is not type-annotated, the type inferer must assign a type that is equivalent to the type inferred for its initialization expression.\nIn a function or method, whenever an argument is not type-annotated, the type inferer must assign the lowest (most specific) type that would be consistent with the use of that argument in the method or function body. If more than one type in different branches of the type hierarchy would be consistent, the type inferer must fail.\nSimilarly, in a type argument, the type inferer must assign the lowest type that is consistent with the use of that argument in all attribute initialization expressions where it is referenced.\n\nIf a type inferer satisfies those constraints, we will say it is sound. This means that, for example, the simplest sound strategy for type inference is to infer types for all expressions and fail for all symbols. We will call this the basic inference strategy.",

Here the * denotes that this expr is not a regular argument, instead it is a special argument that refers to the code inside the brackets after the macro invocation. Thus, you can use the following syntax:\nThe { print(\"Hello World\"); } expression block is precisely what is passed on in the special argument *expr.\nHowever, there is much more going on under that macro invocation. Instead of calling a functor in runtime, macros are expanded in compile time and transpiled into their bodies, which means there is no real repeat function anywhere in the compiled code. Instead, the actual code that is executed is something like:\nThis is the reason why you don’t see expr(); in the macro body, but expr;. That is, the body is not executed but interpolated inside the macro.

    "text": "18.3 Symbolic arguments\nThere are times, though, when you want the macro to reuse a symbol that comes from its external context (a variable or attribute). In these cases, you can use the especial syntax @symbol to define a symbolic argument in the macro, and then bind a specific symbol upon macro expansion.\nThis is best explained with an example. Let’s suppose we want to implement a swap macro that swaps the content of two variables. This cannot be done unless the macro can actually assign to the variables we want to swap. We would define the macro as:\ndef swap(@a: Object, @b: Object) {\n    let temp: Object = a in {\n        a := b;\n        b := temp;\n    }\n}\nAnd we invoke the macro as:\nlet x: Object = 5, y: Object = \"Hello World\" in {\n    swap(@x, @y);\n    print(x);\n    print(y);\n};\nWhich will be expanded to something like (except that _temp will be a generated name):\nlet x: Object = 5, y: Object = \"Hello World\" in {\n    let _temp = x in {\n        x := y;\n        y := _temp;\n    };\n    print(x);\n    print(y);\n};\nNotice how the actual names of the x and y variables are interpolated in the macro expansion. Of course, the type checker will guarantee that on invocation the x and y symbols are variables of the corresponding type.",

    "text": "18.4 Variable placeholders\nMacros can also introduce a new symbol into the scope in which they are expanded, which can then be used in the body argument (or the other arguments). The syntax for this is $symbol. We call this a “variable placeholder”, because it holds the name for a variable that will be introduced upon macro expansion.\nAgain, this is best explained with an example. Let’s add a variable to the repeat macro to indicates the current iteration. We would define the macro as:\ndef repeat($iter: Number, n: Number, *expr:Object) {\n    let iter: Number = 0, total:Number = n in {\n        while (total &gt;= 0) {\n            total := total - 1;\n            expr;\n            iter := iter + 1\n        };\n    }\n}\nNow when calling the macro, you can specify a name for the $iter variable placeholder:\nrepeat(current, 10) {\n    print(current);\n};\nThe effect is that upon macro expansion, the variable placeholder $iter will be renamed to current and thus the body of the macro will correctly reference it. The actual expansion looks similar to the following code:\nlet current: Number = 0, _total:Number = n in {\n    while (_total &gt;= 0) {\n        _total := _total - 1;\n        {\n            print(current);\n        };\n        current := current + 1\n    };\n};\nThe compiler ensures that the use of the new variable in the body of the macro is consistent with the type declared for the variable placeholder in the macro. However, it is entirely possible for the macro not to define the variable, or to define it conditioned on some structure of the body (we will see how that’s achieved in the pattern matching section). In any case, since macro expansion is performed at compile time, any inconsistency that may arise will be captured by the compiler.",

    "section": "18.5 Pattern matching",
    "text": "18.5 Pattern matching\nBy far the most powerful feature of macros is structural pattern matching. This feature allows to deconstruct an argument and generate a specific code depending on the argument structure. The reason this is possible is because macros run on compile time, so when you declare an argument of type Number, for example, what you’ll get in the macro body is the actual expression tree of the argument, and not just the final evaluated object.\nAs everything else with macros, this feature is much better understood with examples. Let’s suppose you want to define a macro called simplify, for no better use than to illustrate how powerful macros are compared to regular functions. This is how you would do it:\ndef simplify(expr:Number) {\n    match(expr) {\n        case (x1:Number + x2:Number) =&gt; simplify(x1) + simplify(x2);\n        case (x1:Number + 0) =&gt; simplify(x1);\n        case (x1:Number - x2:Number) =&gt; simplify(x1) + simplify(x2);\n        case (x1:Number - 0) =&gt; simplify(x1);\n        case (x1:Number * x2:Number) =&gt; simplify(x1) * simplify(x2);\n        case (x1:Number * 1) =&gt; simplify(x1);\n        // ... you get the idea\n        default =&gt; expr;\n    };\n}\nYou would use the macro as follows:\nprint(simplify((42+0)*1);\nAnd the actual generated code would be:\nprint(42);\nNotice that this transformation happens during compilation time, not execution. The actual code that gets compiled is the simplified expression.",

    "text": "1.5 Moving on\nWe are just scratching the surface of what formal language theory can do, and we have already touched upon several areas of computer science.\nWe have defined a super general notion (language) that is ultimately as profound and powerful as the very notion of algorithm. We have identified a central problem in formal language theory (the word problem) that is as deep as the very question of what problems can be solved, at all, with a computer. We connected two fundamental problems in languages (recognizing and generating) and discovered they are but two sides of the same coin. And we left hanging the question of which languages can be solved with which types of algorithms, which is ultimately a question about complexity theory. Phew!\nIn the next few chapters we will continue exploring the world of formal languages. We will dive into the different classes of languages, according to the complexity of their generating and recognizing algorithms. We will find many intringuing unsolvable problems that have deep connections with other areas in computer science, from the most practical to the most esotherical. When we finish this dive, we will have a much more solid understanding of what computers can ultimately do. And then, will turn to programming languages and apply all these ideas to solving the more practical problem of actually building a compiler.\nBuckle up!",
