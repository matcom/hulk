# Building a Compiler

This is the main part of the book. In the following chapters, we will build a HULK compiler from the ground up, in an incremental way. Each chapter is a practical guide to implementing some new feature of the HULK language or the compiler, or some optimization of previous features.

These chapters are based on Jupyter notebooks distributed with the source code of the book, available in the [public Github repository](https://github.com/matcom/hulk). Additionally, the notebooks this part is based on are used to generate a fully working reference implementation of the HULK compiler, which can be installed with `pip install hulk-compiler`.
